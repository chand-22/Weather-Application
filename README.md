# Weather-Application

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- GetX is an excellent framework for managing the state of our application with features like route management and dependency injection.
- This app id created from the OpenWeatherAPI data.
- We'll be making an HTTP request to our API , getting the data in JSON format , creating a model for storing these data and using these models in our screen , and lot of best practices that should be taken into consideration while working on complex projects.
